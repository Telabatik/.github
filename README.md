# Telabatik

Telabatik is an application designed to identify batik motifs to the public. In addition, this classification system is also provided with historical information features of each batik motif, so that users can understand its meaning and origin more easily. This application aims to preserve and promote batik culture in the middle of globalization that makes many people begin to forget their cultural heritage, especially batik.
